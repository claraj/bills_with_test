# bills_with_test
Java students:

1. Write the rest of the program. Focus on writing small, testable methods. 
    Keep all user input in one method, and all output in one other method. You'll have to test these methods by running the program.*
2. Write a test for each method. 

* you can create tests that provide user input and read what's being displayed on the console if you really want.

But it's probably easier to have the output String generated by another method that you can test, and write tests for that.
